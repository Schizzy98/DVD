# DVD Bouncy thingy 
-- Installation
--- Prerequisites
---- In order to run this, it requires the love2d libraries. You can find out more about them here: https://love2d.org/
---- Run the binary according to your OS and then to run this use the command `love "/path/to/dvd"` or if you are in the dvd directory run `love .`

-- What it does
--- All this does is draws a rectangle to the speed and it bounces around the screen.
--- It's a test build for another project in the works :)
